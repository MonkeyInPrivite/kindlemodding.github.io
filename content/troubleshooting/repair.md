# Unbricking a Kindle

<p class="caution">This guide will only cover simple bootloops, more complex bricks or "hard bricks" are usually much more complex and unknown. Please ask in the <a href="http://discord.kindlemodding.org/">Kindle Modding Discord Server</a> for support if this is your scenario.</p>

Sometimes things go wrong when jailbreaking or messing around. Here is a known method of fixing most bricks.

## Prerequisites

- **Patience**
- Preferably a PC, but a Mac can work
- Decent technical experience
- A cable that supports data transfer

## Is it actually bricked?
First, lets figure out if your Kindle is actually bricked  

1. See if holding down the power button for about 5 seconds pops up a screen thats lets you restart and if it does then do so.
2. If it does not or your Kindle is still bricked, then hold down the power button for about a minute and it should force restart.

If this still does not work/did not fix your issue, continue on.

## Forcefully restarting your Kindle 

1. Wait for the battery to run out *(This could take an **extremely** long time)* and then plug it in.
2. If you are comfortable with doing so, open up your Kindle and unplug the battery. Then just plug it back in.

## Accessing your Kindle with a Computer
<p class="important">If you are not able to access your Kindle with a computer, this guide will not work for you. Please read the warning above for next steps.</p>

This portion of the guide will help you gain access to your Kindle's filesystem.

### PC Instructions 
1. Grab a data supported USB cable
2. Plug in your Kindle to your computer
3. If it's not showing up, try waiting a bit or restarting your Kindle
4. Once you have access to the Kindle, open the root (where the documents and audible folders are).
5. Create a file on the root ***with no extension*** called `DO_FACTORY_RESTORE` and restart your Kindle
6. Your Kindle should now go back to the initial setup, and you are officially unbricked!

### Mac Instructions 
- If you are on an older Kindle, you should be able to follow the PC instructions. The instructions below are for newer (MTP) Kindles
- You can tell if your Kindle is MTP if it does not automatically appear when you plug it in on Mac.

If your Kindle is MTP, you will need to install either the [Amazon Send to Kindle App](https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/mac?&linkCode=ll2&tag=ter000-20&linkId=07f7c7db67889bf36e836471c479526e&la) or [OpenMTP](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/).
You should now be able to follow the PC instructions.

## Conclusion 
Hopefully this Debricked your Kindle! If you still need support, join the [Kindle Modding Community](https://discord.kindlemodding.org/) and open a ticket in the [#questions-and-support](https://discord.com/channels/1083603487025274911/1112755307521769583) channel.
